We will permanently delete from our records any personal information that is not necessary for our business operations and direct our service providers to do the same.</p><p>We consider information to be necessary for our business operations if it is used to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Complete an obligation to you that you have requested;</li><li>Detect and resolve issues related to security or functionality;</li><li>Comply with legal obligations; and</li><li>Enable solely internal uses.</li></ul><h4><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong></h4><p>If you exercise your CCPA consumer rights:</p><ul role="list"><li>We will not deny goods or services to you;</li><li>We will not charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or penalties; and</li><li>We will not provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you.</li></ul><h4><strong>Right to Opt-Out</strong></h4><p>You have the right to opt-out of any selling and sharing of your personal information.</p><p>You may exercise your right to opt-out <a href="https://privacy.weekday.works/opt-out">here</a>.</p><h3><strong>Request Verification</strong></h3><p>Before we can respond to a Request to Know or Request to Delete, we will need to verify that you are the consumer who is the subject of the CCPA request.

Requests to Opt-Out do not require verification.</p><p>Typically, identity verification will require you to confirm certain information about yourself based on information we have already collected. For example, we will ask you to verify that you have access to the email address we have on file for you. If we cannot verify your identity based on our records, we cannot fulfil your CCPA request.</p><p>For a request that seeks specific personal information, we ask that you sign a declaration stating that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request, as required by the CCPA.</p><p>In some cases, we may have no reasonable method by which we can verify a consumer's identity. For example:</p><ul role="list"><li>If a consumer submits a request but we have not collected any personal information about that consumer, we cannot verify the request.</li><li>If the only data we have collected about a consumer is gathered through website cookies (i.e., the consumer visited our website but had no other interaction with us), we are unable to reasonably associate a requester with any data collected; therefore, we cannot verify the request.</li></ul><h4><strong>Authorized Agent</strong></h4><p>A California resident's authorized agent may submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete under the CCPA by emailing us at <a href="about:blank.html">privacy@weekday.works.</a>submitted by an authorized agent will still require verification of the person who is the subject of the request in accordance with the process described above. We will also ask for proof that the person who is the subject of the request authorized an agent to submit a privacy request on their behalf.
